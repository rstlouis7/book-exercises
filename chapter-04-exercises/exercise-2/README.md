# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.


**Course Number**   |   _Course Title_   |   Instructor Name   
--- | --- | ---
**15324A**   |   _INFO 201_   |   Kyle Thayer
**15329A**   |   _INFO 201 Lab_   | Bradley Ignatius Balansay
